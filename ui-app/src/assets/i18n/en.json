    "FOR_EXAMPLE": "<p class=\"ztt_panel-text\"> For example, let’s assume you’ve accepted a working capital advance with the following terms:</p><p class=\"ztt_panel-text\">Amount: $10,000 <br>% of daily sales: 15% <br>Fee: $3,000 <br>Total owed: $13,000</p><p class=\"ztt_panel-text\">If on a given day you make $1,000 in gross sales, you’ll repay $150 towards the total amount owed. You’ll have $12,850 left to pay back. And if you make $2000 in sales the following day, your next payment will be $300. You’ll continue to pay 15% of each day’s sales until the total advance plus fee amount is repaid.</p>",
    "THE_FEE_IS": "<p class=\"ztt_panel-text\"> The fee is the cost of the advance. In addition to paying back the advance amount, you will also pay back the fee. Before you apply, the fee is approximated. You’ll have an opportunity to see the actual fee before you sign the terms and conditions for the advance. </p><p class=\"ztt_panel-text\">    Related to the fee is a figure called total amount owed. This is the sum of the fee and your advance. Each daily payment repays part of the advance and part of the fee until you’ve repayed the total amount owed.</p>",
    "THE_PERCENTAGE_OF": "<p class=\"ztt_panel-text\">It’s the percentage of your gross sales that you agree to pay back each day. By using a percent, the daily dollar-value of the payback amount ebbs and flows with your sales. This way you always have enough money left over to pay for all the other essential things your business does!</p>",
    "TIME_TO_PAY": "<p class=\"ztt_panel-text\"> The time to pay off your advance depends on the total amount owed and the % of daily sales you choose for payback. But in general, we expect it might take 3 or 4 months. If you have exceptional sales, it may take a little less time, and if sales are more sluggish than usual, it may take a bit more.</p>",
    "WORKING_CAPITAL_ADVANCE": "<p class=\"ztt_panel-text\">A working capital advance is an agreement to sell some of your future sales. You get you the money you need now, and the amount you pay back each day follows the same ebbs and flows as your sales. It’s a quick and easy way to get the extra funds your business needs to get things done. </p><p class=\"ztt_panel-text\"> Get a little or get a lot - whatever your business needs right now. Most people see the cash in their bank account within 48 hours of starting the process.</p>"
